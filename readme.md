## First game made in unity by three friends to get good mark for a game dev classes in university.
# Concept:
You are locked up in university building and have to escape.


It's not a great game but has some interesting mechanics:
Sanity mechanic (sanity loss in dark and due to time past)
Simple light detection (just a collider)
Some interesting puzzles (comming soon)
